📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis and Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and cleaning to SQL analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard and professional reports.

The project covers:

Data loading using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL analysis using MySQL Workbench / SQL Server

Dashboard creation using Power BI

Report generation and presentation using Gamma

This project highlights practical skills required for Data Analyst roles, including Python, SQL, and Power BI.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business/customer/sales information.

It includes multiple columns such as categorical variables, numerical values, and identifiers.

The dataset was used to analyze trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

Example fields may include:

Customer ID

Product Category

Sales Amount

Date

Region

Quantity

(Replace with your actual dataset description if needed.)
